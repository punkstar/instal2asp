This repository contains the instal2asp program for compiling InstAL specification(s) into their corresponding ASP.

This repository uses git submodules.  When you first checkout this repository you'll need to run the following to bring in the submodule dependencies.

git submodule init
git submodule update

To build the instal2asp program (which is really just a bash wrapper around a java invoke) run the build process, which is controlled by make, with:

make build

To execute tests, run:

make test

For program usage information, which is always up to date due to the jcommader usage for option parsing, run:

./instal2asp --help
